### Notes
I ran into a mysterious problem that caused my app to crash when I was very close to completion. I contacted the TAs on Slack and received help remarkably fast (within, maybe, 3 minutes). It turned out I had misplaced one of my IBOutlet connections. Other than that, the work has corresponded with the expected level of difficulty.

### Notes
This app was not particularly challenging -- all the instructions came from the lecture recordings. Adjusting all the auto-layout constraints took me some time, but I was able to do it without losing my mind so all is good.
